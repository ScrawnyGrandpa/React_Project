- React Cards Project

Welcome to the React Cards Project! This README provides an overview of the project and its key features.
Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using React, Vite, and MUI. It leverages advanced JavaScript techniques such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and local storage to enhance functionality and user experience. The project is built from scratch, deviating from the course structure to offer a fresh approach.

* About Page: Provides information about the project.
* Error Page: Displays a friendly error message in case of issues.

* Card Management:
    - Create New Card: Add new cards to the system via a button at the bottom right eligable users screen.
    - Edit Card: Modify existing cards that belong to the user.
    - Delete Card: Remove cards as needed.
    - Favorite Cards: Mark cards as favorites from any page where cards are displayed.
